# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Performing analysis on Kickstarter to uncover trends
---
*In this project, we explore many different trends in the outcomes for Kickstarter funding campaigns for the Theatrical category.
*We start with a Meta view of both Successful and Failed theater campaigns based on month as well as pull out specific US based theatrical campaigns both successful and failed.
*Statistical analysis is also provided for both successful and failed theatrical campaigns and wearables campaigns. 
*What we find in this analysis is that April-August is the best time to launch a successful theater campaign.
*Theater campains are successful more than not.
*Successful theater campaigns additionally have a lower goal(median goal of $3000) than failed campaigns (median goal of $5000). Successful theater campaigns also have a higher median pledge ($3168) compared to failed campaigns ($103).
*When compared to another category (Wearables) we see the same trend in goals and pledges.
